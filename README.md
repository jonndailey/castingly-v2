# Castingly v2 🎭

> **Professional Casting Platform for Actors, Agents, and Casting Directors**

A comprehensive platform built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and MySQL that connects the entertainment industry through streamlined casting processes, profile management, and professional networking.

## 🚀 Current Status: **Production Ready - Fully Migrated**

### Recent Updates (Oct 2025)
- Mobile polish across actor dashboards, submissions, opportunities, and profile
  - Buttons and tabs are readable on phones and remain large tap‑targets
  - Bottom nav active line removed; highlight state is sufficient
  - Public Profile card now uses a copyable input with full‑width buttons on mobile
- Real profile completion with hide option
  - Completion is calculated from profile fields + media (headshot + gallery)
  - Users can hide the banner (stored in `profiles.metadata.preferences.hideProfileCompletion`)
- Faster, resilient images
  - `/api/media/proxy` issues 302 redirects to working URLs and picks the best image variant
  - Short DMAPI timeouts to avoid page stalls; longer cache for proxy/avatar redirects
- Distinct logins per role
  - When authenticating via Dailey Core, Castingly overrides the role from the users table if present to ensure agent/casting/admin experiences are correct
- Navigation and routing
  - Removed the standalone "Submit" link; `/actor/submit` is only reachable when applying to a role (via `?opportunity=...`)

### New: Inside Connect (Representation)
- Embedded two‑sided marketplace for actors ↔ agents
- Endpoints
  - `GET/POST /api/connect/listings`, `GET/PATCH /api/connect/listings/:id`
  - `GET/POST /api/connect/submissions`, `PATCH /api/connect/submissions/:id`
  - `GET/PUT /api/connect/agency` (agent profile), `PUT /api/connect/prefs` (actor visibility)
- UI
  - Actor: `/actor/connect`
  - Agent: `/agent/connect` (inbox), `/agent/connect/listings` (manage)
- DB migrations
  - `database/migrations/20251026_inside_connect.sql`
  - Index fixes: `database/migrations/20251026_inside_connect_fix_indexes.sql`
- Seeding (dev/cluster)
  - `scripts/seed-inside-connect.sql` (base)
  - `scripts/seed-inside-connect-more.sql` (more listings)
  - `scripts/seed-inside-connect-submissions-simple.sql` (sample inbox)
- Migration helper
  - `scripts/apply-inside-connect.mjs` (env‑aware, idempotent)

### Login + UI polish
- Login page icons use lucide‑react (no emojis); removed broken Core image and “Powered by Dailey Core” line.
- Auth indicator is a small pill near Logout (desktop sidebar) instead of a large banner.
- Profile photo consistency: Actor Profile uses the same source as Dashboard (`/api/media/avatar/:id` fallback).
- Mobile avatar camera button made smaller (reduced border/ring/shadow).

### Avatar persistence + DMAPI pointers
- Avatars are stored in DMAPI (bucket `castingly-public`) under `actors/:actorId/headshots`.
- The app keeps a short pointer in the DB for fast resolution:
  - `users.avatar_url` → short proxy URL (`/api/media/proxy?...`)
  - `profiles.metadata.avatar` → structured pointer `{bucket,userId,path,name}`
- Upload flow now writes both pointers on headshot upload.
- The avatar endpoint (`/api/media/avatar/:id`) has a fallback:
  - If DB pointer is missing, it lists DMAPI headshots, returns a redirect, and persists the pointer(s) for next time.

Utilities
- Backfill existing avatars (app-assisted):
  - `MIGRATION_ENV=.env.production node scripts/backfill-avatars-via-app.mjs --force --host http://127.0.0.1:3003`
  - Optional single user: `--id <userId>`
- Backfill via DMAPI service (requires Core login to succeed):
  - `MIGRATION_ENV=.env.production node scripts/backfill-avatars.mjs --force`
  - Note: if Core rejects with “Invalid application”, use the app-assisted script above.

### Profile saves across mixed schemas
- Profile update only writes columns that exist (`profiles` table introspection) to avoid “Unknown column” errors.
- Headshot uploads trigger a client `reloadMedia()` for immediate counters and thumbnails.

## 🔐 Authentication Integration

Castingly v2 is **fully integrated** with the DAILEY CORE authentication system:

### Features
- **RSA JWT Authentication**: Uses RS256 algorithm with DAILEY CORE as the authority
- **Hybrid Authentication**: Supports DAILEY CORE, legacy accounts, and demo users
- **JWT Validation Strategy**: Validates RS256 tokens via Core's JWKS (`/.well-known/jwks.json`) with optional `/auth/validate` check when available
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic token refresh for seamless user experience
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Authentication badges showing current auth source
- **Role Mapping**: Maps DAILEY CORE roles to Castingly application roles

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login**: Users authenticate via API which tries DAILEY CORE first
2. **Token Issuance**: DAILEY CORE issues RSA-signed JWT tokens
3. **Validation**: Frontend validates tokens locally via JWKS; falls back to Core `/auth/validate` when available
4. **Fallback**: System supports legacy and demo accounts for development
5. **Status Display**: UI shows authentication source with color-coded badges

### Developer Features
- **Role Switching**: Development mode allows quick role switching
- **Test Users**: Access to real migrated actor accounts for testing
- **Authentication Status**: Visual indicators in sidebar showing auth source

## 📦 Media Storage (DMAPI)

The application includes a full integration with the **Dailey Media API (DMAPI)**. API routes and UI components already target DMAPI for listings, uploads, and deletions, but the legacy filesystem (`downloaded_images/`, `downloaded_resumes/`) still holds the canonical assets until the migration script is executed.

- **Public & Private buckets** (`castingly-public`, `castingly-private`) are preconfigured via metadata so DMAPI can mirror the legacy folder structure.
- **Categorised metadata** (headshots, reels, resumes, self-tapes, documents, voice overs) is attached during migration for downstream filtering.
- **Signed URLs** will be generated on demand for private media once the data resides in DMAPI.
- **Admin tooling** already queries DMAPI, falling back to legacy records when the integration credentials are missing or the migration has not been run.

### Migrating Legacy Assets

Use the provided migration script to elevate legacy filesystem + MySQL media into DMAPI.

```bash
# Dry-run the migration first (no uploads)
node scripts/migrate-media-to-dmapi.mjs --dry-run

# Migrate everything with a short delay between uploads
DMAPI_MIGRATION_DELAY_MS=200 node scripts/migrate-media-to-dmapi.mjs

# Resume a partial migration from a specific actor_media ID
node scripts/migrate-media-to-dmapi.mjs --start-at 1050
```

Environment variables in `.env.local` are reused automatically. Ensure the following are present for the service account that can access both Dailey Core and DMAPI:

- `DMAPI_SERVICE_EMAIL` / `DMAPI_SERVICE_PASSWORD`
- `DMAPI_BASE_URL`
- `DAILEY_CORE_AUTH_URL`
- `DMAPI_APP_ID` (defaults to `castingly`)

The script will:

1. Ensure the DMAPI application record exists.
2. Mirror Dailey Core user references for media ownership.
3. Upload media, tagging `sourceActorId`, `sourceMediaId`, and actor contact metadata.
4. Enrich DMAPI metadata for downstream querying.
5. Preserve the legacy directory structure through the `folderPath` metadata so DMAPI's browser UI reflects familiar actor-centric folders.

> **Note:** Until `DMAPI_SERVICE_EMAIL` / `DMAPI_SERVICE_PASSWORD` are supplied and the migration completes, most actors will continue to read media from the legacy directories.

1) Environment setup
- Create `.env.production` (or export env vars) using `.env.example` as a reference.
- Set:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_DAILEY_CORE_AUTH_URL=https://core.dailey.cloud`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_DMAPI_BASE_URL=https://media.dailey.cloud`
  - Toggle `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_INVESTOR_DEMO=true` only on investor demo environments.

2) Build and start with PM2
```bash
npm ci
npm run build
pm2 start ecosystem.production.cjs --env production
pm2 save
```

## 🖧 Servers & Access (Ops Notes)

This repo is developed and deployed from the dev workstation (“king”), with a remote app server (“dev”) and a separate database cluster.

- Dev Workstation “king” (you are here)
  - Code: `/home/jonny/apps/castingly-v2`
  - Local MySQL (for development):
    - Host: `127.0.0.1`, Port: `3306`
    - User: `nikon`, Password: `@0509man1hattaN`
    - DB: `casting_portal`
  - Typical usage: edit code, run local MySQL, commit/push to GitHub, rsync to the app server.

- App Server “dev” (runs Castingly under PM2)
  - SSH: `ssh dev`
  - Code: `~/apps/castingly-v2`
  - Build/Restart:
    - `npm run build`
    - `pm2 restart castingly-v2 --update-env`
  - Runtime: Next.js behind Apache proxy → `http://127.0.0.1:3003` (domain: `https://castingly.dailey.dev`)
  - DB: connects to the cluster via local port `3307` (tunnel/service)
  - Safe place to run env‑aware schema helper:
    - `MIGRATION_ENV=.env.production node scripts/apply-inside-connect.mjs`

- Database Cluster
  - coredb1 (primary): `40.160.239.176`
    - SSH: `ssh ubuntu@40.160.239.176`, then `sudo -i`
    - MySQL root password: `/root/.mysql_root_pw`
    - App DB: `castingly` (for Castingly features, e.g., Inside Connect)
    - Core DB: `dailey_core_auth` (Dailey Core auth service)
    - Apply schema as root (example):
      - `mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS castingly CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"`
      - `mysql -u root -p castingly < database/migrations/20251026_inside_connect.sql`
      - `mysql -u root -p castingly < database/migrations/20251026_inside_connect_fix_indexes.sql`
  - coredb2 (replica): `40.160.239.175`
    - Replicates from coredb1; do not apply writes here
    - (Optional) Verify replication with `SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G`

- Media API (DMAPI)
  - Base URL (prod): `https://media.dailey.cloud` (see `DMAPI_BASE_URL`)
  - Used by upload routes; short timeouts to avoid UI stalls

Quick deploy from king → dev app server:
```bash
rsync -az --delete --exclude '.git' --exclude 'node_modules' --exclude '.next' \
      --exclude '.env.production' --exclude '.env.local' ./ dev:~/apps/castingly-v2/
ssh dev 'bash -lc "cd ~/apps/castingly-v2 && npm run build && pm2 restart castingly-v2 --update-env"'
```

3) Nginx
- Proxy `server_name castingly.dailey.cloud` to `127.0.0.1:3000`.
- Add no‑cache headers for `index.html` to avoid stale SPA after deploys.

## 🔧 Dev Server Status (Quick Reference)

## 🧪 Demo Accounts (Core → Castingly tenant)

These users exist in `dailey_core_auth.users` and are joined to the `castingly` tenant. Use for demos/tests.

- Investor: `investor.demo@castingly.com` / `Inv3stor!2025`
- Actor: `actor.demo@castingly.com` / `Act0r!2025`
- Agent: `agent.demo@castingly.com` / `Ag3nt!2025`
- Casting Director: `director.demo@castingly.com` / `D1rect0r!2025`
- Admin: `admin.demo@castingly.com` / `Adm1n!2025`

Core auth test (should return a token):

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://core.dailey.cloud/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{"email":"actor.demo@castingly.com","password":"Act0r!2025","app_slug":"castingly-portal"}'
```

## 🐞 Core Auth Login Issue (Tracking)

Symptom
- UI POST `https://castingly.dailey.dev/api/auth/login` returns 401 with “Invalid email or password”.
- Server logs show `Dailey Core auth failed … Invalid application`.

Known Good
- Direct Core call (above) returns an `access_token` using `app_slug=castingly-portal`.

Current Hypothesis
- A header/body mismatch to Core causes rejection when called from the server. We removed `X-Client-Id` and send only `Content-Type` and optional `X-Tenant-Slug`. Ensure the server is using the latest build and env.

What to Verify
1) Env in `~/apps/castingly-v2/.env.production`:
   - `DAILEY_CORE_AUTH_URL=https://core.dailey.cloud`
   - `DAILEY_CORE_APP_SLUG=castingly-portal`
   - `DAILEY_CORE_TENANT_SLUG=castingly`
   - (no `DAILEY_CORE_CLIENT_ID`)
2) Rebuild + restart:
   - `npm run build && pm2 restart castingly-v2 --update-env`
3) Tail server logs during a login:
   - `pm2 logs castingly-v2 --lines 200`
  - Expect to see log line with: `Attempting login for … (baseUrl=https://core.dailey.cloud, appSlug=castingly-portal, tenant=castingly, clientId=n/a)`

If still failing
- Add diagnostic: temporarily log Core response `{status, data}` and the outbound payload headers (password redacted). Compare against working curl.
- Token validation uses JWKS locally; `/auth/validate` errors do not block login. Investigate Core logs for `/auth/validate` if needed.
- As a temporary demo fallback, set `ENABLE_LEGACY_AUTH_FALLBACK=true` in `.env.production` to allow legacy auth while Core headers are tuned.

## 📘 Definitive Integration: Core + DMAPI + DB

- Core auth (recommended pattern)
  - Use app and tenant slugs, not a client id
  - POST `/auth/login` body: `{ email, password, app_slug, tenant_slug }`
  - Optionally send `X-Client-Id: <app_slug>` and `X-Tenant-Slug: <tenant_slug>`
  - Token validation: verify RS256 JWTs against Core JWKS at `/.well-known/jwks.json`; use `/auth/validate` only as a best‑effort check
  - Reference: `../dailey-core/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` (Critical Update section)

- DMAPI integration
  - Accepts Bearer tokens issued by Core and verifies locally via JWKS
  - Optional best‑effort call to Core `/auth/validate` when available
  - Reference: `../dailey-media-api/docs/DEPLOYMENT_CORE_INTEGRATION.md` (Token Validation Strategy)
  - Production env (server):
    - `DMAPI_BASE_URL=https://media.dailey.cloud`
    - `DMAPI_SERVICE_EMAIL` / `DMAPI_SERVICE_PASSWORD` (required for server reads/uploads)
    - Optional: `DMAPI_LIST_USER_ID=<service_subject_id>` to scope bucket folder listings for profile headshots
  - Private files (resumes): served via app proxy `GET /api/media/proxy?bucket=castingly-private&userId=<svcUser>&path=actors/<actorId>/resumes&name=<file>` so the UI never reveals DMAPI credentials.

- MySQL cluster access
  - Use an SSH tunnel locally: listen on `127.0.0.1:3307`, connect to cluster primary/HA
  - App env: `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`, `DB_PORT=3307`, `DB_USER/DB_PASSWORD/DB_NAME` per app
  - Quick test: `mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3307 -u <user> -p -e 'SELECT 1' <db>`
  - Reference: `../dailey-core/docs/MYSQL_CORE_DMAPI_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md`

Notes on legacy profile reads
- The profile API reads legacy tables. When a Core UUID reaches `/api/actors/:id`, the API now falls back to map via email from the bearer token to the legacy numeric id before loading the profile.

## 🛠️ Current Integration Status (Oct 2025)

- Core login: working end-to-end (slug-based, RS256+JWKS).
- Actor profile API: returns 200 for authenticated users (builds a minimal profile when legacy row is missing). Public headshots are listed from DMAPI buckets; private resumes stream via `/api/media/proxy`.
- Forum activity: uses new schema fields (`name`, `avatar_url`). Endpoint requires authentication.
- DMAPI audience: temporarily permissive (accepts any Core audience). Plan: set `CORE_AUDIENCE=<Castingly app_id>` and remove `ALLOW_CORE_ANY_AUD`.
- DMAPI DB: uploads succeed to storage; a small DB patch (ensure application row exists) removes occasional FK insert failures and populates `/api/files` immediately.

## 🖼️ Uploads & Limits (Current Behavior)

- User upload flows
  - Dashboard camera: uploads a headshot inline and updates avatar immediately.
  - Profile Media: headshots/gallery show counters (x/20) and fill space as soon as the upload starts.
  - The “Upload Media” page link has been removed; uploads are inline.

- Server limits (enforced)
  - Size caps: reels up to 500MB; images/docs capped by env.
  - Count caps: headshots/gallery 20, reels 10 (temporarily relaxed while DMAPI list is stabilized).
  - Env knobs (Castingly):
    - `MEDIA_LIMIT_IMAGE_COUNT` (default 20)
    - `MEDIA_LIMIT_REEL_COUNT` (default 10)
    - `MEDIA_LIMIT_REEL_MAX_MB` (default 500)
    - `DISABLE_IMAGE_LIMITS=true` (temporarily bypass headshot/gallery count while DMAPI list is being fixed)

- DMAPI integration flags
  - `DMAPI_DISABLE_DB_LIST=true` (on DMAPI): bypass DB listing and use storage fallback; faster and avoids list SQL errors.
  - PM2: disable `watch` for dmapi-backend in production; `pm2 save` to persist.

- Reset endpoint (cleanup)
  - POST `/api/admin/media/reset-actor/:actorId` with header `x-confirm: purge` purges headshots/gallery for that actor.
  - Uses DMAPI storage folder fallback (no DB required) and returns JSON `{success, deleted, failed[]}`.

- Upload responses (simplified)
  - APIs return a single file entry with `id`, and when DMAPI DB is delayed, a `signed_url` and `proxy_url` for immediate use.
  - The UI prefers a usable URL so the image persists across refresh immediately.

## 🧰 DMAPI Fixes (Planned/Applied)

- Applied now
  - Feature-flagged DB listing off: `DMAPI_DISABLE_DB_LIST=true` to avoid `mysqld_stmt_execute` errors and latency.
  - Hardened JSON parsing in duplicate-hash lookup paths to avoid `Unexpected end of JSON input`.

- Next patches
  - Replace `COUNT(*) OVER()` with separate `COUNT(*)` in DB list; whitelist `order_by` binding.
  - Gate pdf processing to `application/pdf` to stop pdfjs parse noise.
  - Disable pm2 `watch` for dmapi-backend; `pm2 save`.

## 🔒 Production Checklist (Castingly server)

- Core
  - `DAILEY_CORE_AUTH_URL=https://core.dailey.cloud`
  - `DAILEY_CORE_APP_SLUG=castingly-portal`
  - `DAILEY_CORE_TENANT_SLUG=castingly`
  - Do not set `DAILEY_CORE_CLIENT_ID` unless you have a provisioned value.
- DMAPI
  - `DMAPI_BASE_URL=https://media.dailey.cloud`
  - `DMAPI_SERVICE_EMAIL=dmapi-service@castingly.com`
  - `DMAPI_SERVICE_PASSWORD=******`
  - Optional: `DMAPI_LIST_USER_ID=<service_subject_id>` for bucket-scoped folder listings
- DB (cluster via tunnel)
  - `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`
  - `DB_PORT=3307`
  - `DB_USER/DB_PASSWORD/DB_NAME` as provisioned

## 🧯 Troubleshooting (common)

- 404 on `/api/actors/:id` after successful login
  - Cause: UI request missing Authorization header; server can’t map Core UUID.
  - Fix: pass `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on all actor fetches (talent pages updated).
- 500 on forum endpoints
  - Cause: queries referenced legacy columns (`first_name`, `profile_image`).
  - Fix: updated to `name`, `avatar_url`. Require authentication on `/api/forum/activity/:userId`.
- Private resume not rendering
  - Use `/api/media/proxy` to stream from DMAPI with the server’s service token.

## 🔜 DMAPI Hardening (next)

- Set `CORE_AUDIENCE=<Castingly Core app_id>` on DMAPI and remove `ALLOW_CORE_ANY_AUD=true`.
- Add `ensureApplication('castingly')` before `media_files` inserts to avoid FK failures; keep `ensureUser` as-is.
- Keep Castingly proxy for private files; use DMAPI direct serve URLs for public headshots.

## 🔍 Quick Checks

App health
```bash
pm2 status castingly-v2
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:3003/api/admin/system/health | jq
```

DB tunnel
```bash
lsof -iTCP:3307 -sTCP:LISTEN
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3307 -ucastingly_app -p -e 'SELECT 1' castingly
```

Apache → app
```bash
curl -I https://castingly.dailey.dev/
```

## 🧯 Troubleshooting: Profile 500 on /api/actors/:id

Symptoms
- Browser console shows 500 errors for `/api/actors/<uuid>` after a successful login.

Likely causes
- Database connectivity mismatch. The API routes use the legacy Castingly DB via MySQL. In production, access is through an SSH tunnel on `127.0.0.1:3307`, but `.env.production` may be pointing to the cluster IP/port directly.
- Schema mismatch. Production DB uses `users` + `profiles` + `media` (no `actors` or `actor_media`). The server has been aligned to this schema.

Fix
- Set DB env to the tunnel and restart:
  - `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`
  - `DB_PORT=3307`
  - `DB_USER/DB_PASSWORD/DB_NAME` as provisioned
  - `pm2 restart castingly-v2 --update-env`
- Verify tunnel and DB:
  - `lsof -iTCP:3307 -sTCP:LISTEN`
  - `mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P3307 -ucastingly_app -p -e 'SELECT 1' castingly`
- Health endpoint:
  - `curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:3003/api/admin/system/health | jq`

Notes
- This endpoint reads from the legacy schema (`lib/db_existing.ts`). Production schema is `users` + `profiles` + `media`; the code has been updated accordingly.
- If you pass a Core UUID that doesn’t exist in `users`, the API now falls back to a minimal Core‑derived profile so the page renders (200). For a complete profile, add a `users` row (char(36) id) and an associated `profiles` row, or run the migration.
- For details on the standard DB access pattern, see `../dailey-core/docs/MYSQL_CORE_DMAPI_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md`.


### User Migration to Dailey Core

Use the tools in `~/apps/dailey-core` to import legacy users so they benefit from Core’s replication:
1. Copy `scripts/migrate-logins.config.example.json` to `scripts/migrate-logins.config.json` and point the source to `casting_portal.users`.
   - `target.defaultTenantId`: `22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222`
   - `target.defaultAppId`: `66666666-6666-6666-6666-666666666666`
   - Map `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `password_hash` (sha256 → generally requires reset), timestamps.
2. Run:
```bash
cd ~/apps/dailey-core
node scripts/migrate-logins.js --config=./scripts/migrate-logins.config.json --dry-run
node scripts/migrate-logins.js --config=./scripts/migrate-logins.config.json
```

### Media Migration to DMAPI

Run from this repo to move all media to production DMAPI:
```bash
export DMAPI_BASE_URL=https://media.dailey.cloud
export DAILEY_CORE_AUTH_URL=https://core.dailey.cloud
export DMAPI_SERVICE_EMAIL=dmapi-service@castingly.com
export DMAPI_SERVICE_PASSWORD=castingly_dmapi_service_2025

# Dry run
node scripts/migrate-media-to-dmapi.mjs --dry-run

# Live run
DMAPI_MIGRATION_DELAY_MS=200 node scripts/migrate-media-to-dmapi.mjs
```

The script ensures the DMAPI application and user references exist, uploads files, and enriches metadata for Castingly.
